## 🎯 Pattern Categories

### 🏗️ Creational Patterns
Patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

### 🔄 Behavioral Patterns
Patterns that identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns.

### 🏢 Structural Patterns
Patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.

## 🚀 Usage

Each pattern has its own directory with an `index.php` file that demonstrates the pattern's implementation and usage.

To run any pattern example:

```bash
cd path/to/pattern
php index.php
